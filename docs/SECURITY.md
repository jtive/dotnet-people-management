## GitHub Actions Security

### Secret Exposure Prevention

**CRITICAL**: Never use `echo` commands with secrets in GitHub Actions workflows, as they will be logged and visible to anyone with repository access.

#### ❌ SECURITY VULNERABILITY (Fixed)
```yaml
# DON'T DO THIS - Secrets will be visible in logs
- name: Set database environment variables
  run: |
    echo "DB_HOST=${{ secrets.DB_HOST }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "DB_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

#### ✅ SECURE APPROACH
```yaml
# DO THIS - Secrets are not logged
- name: Deploy application
  run: |
    # Your deployment commands here
  env:
    DB_HOST: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST }}
    DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
```

### GitHub Actions Security Best Practices

1. **Use `env` section instead of `echo`**
   - Environment variables set in the `env` section are not logged
   - `echo` commands with secrets are visible in action logs

2. **Repository Visibility**
   - Public repositories: Anyone can see action logs and secrets would be exposed
   - Private repositories: Only repository collaborators can see action logs
   - Organization repositories: Follow organization security policies

3. **Environment Protection**
   - Use GitHub Environments with required reviewers
   - Set environment-specific secrets
   - Use environment protection rules

4. **Secret Management**
   - Never hardcode secrets in workflow files
   - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use least-privilege access

### Log Visibility

#### Who Can See GitHub Actions Logs?

- **Public Repositories**: Anyone on the internet
- **Private Repositories**: Repository collaborators
- **Organization Repositories**: Organization members with appropriate permissions

#### What Gets Logged?

- All `echo` output (including secrets)
- Command output and errors
- Environment variable names (but not values when set via `env`)
- Step execution details

### Fixed Security Issues

The following security vulnerabilities have been addressed:

1. **Secret Exposure in Logs**: Removed `echo` commands that would expose database credentials
2. **Environment Variable Security**: Moved secret assignment to `env` sections
3. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Removed all hardcoded database connection strings

### Monitoring and Auditing

1. **Review Action Logs**: Regularly review GitHub Actions logs for any accidental secret exposure
2. **Access Logs**: Monitor who has access to repository and action logs
3. **Secret Rotation**: Regularly rotate database passwords and API keys
4. **Audit Trail**: Use GitHub's audit log to track access and changes

### Additional Security Measures

1. **Repository Settings**
   - Enable branch protection rules
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Restrict who can push to main branch

2. **Organization Security**
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Use SSO for organization members
   - Regular security reviews

3. **Application Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Regular security updates and patches

### Incident Response

If secrets are accidentally exposed:

1. **Immediately rotate the exposed secrets**
2. **Review action logs to determine scope of exposure**
3. **Update workflow files to prevent future exposure**
4. **Notify relevant stakeholders**
5. **Document the incident and remediation steps**
